🎮 Game Brief: Esport Manager - The Codebreaker
🧠 Game Overview:
 "Esport Manager: The Codebreaker" is a simulation game where players take on the role of a professional esports team manager in a tactical FPS league. Inspired by the structure of real-life Valorant tournaments (without using any copyrighted content), the game features AI-powered agents, strategic match planning, player scouting, and tournament progression. All world-building content is dynamically generated to provide a unique, original experience.
⚠️ Important Licensing Note:
 This game does not use any official assets, names, or likenesses from the game Valorant or its affiliated teams. The term "The Codebreaker" is used as the game's name to avoid any legal conflicts with Riot Games or associated entities. Player and team data generated in-game will strictly relate to the tactical FPS genre and will not include athletes or esports professionals from unrelated game genres (e.g., MOBA). For instance, if the AI generates team rosters from well-known organizations like T1 or Sentinels, it will only consider the FPS (Valorant) division and exclude figures like Faker or Gumayusi, who are part of League of Legends.
